# TrackIt (front-end)
It's an app to track your habits. As a juggler I like to keep track of my trainings.

## About 
In this app you can add/remove habits from your list and the app will show you the habits that were supposed to be done that day. After you're done with the habit, you can check them and get that sense of accomplishment we all love. It also shows how long you have been keeping up with that habit.
Below are the implemented features:

* Sign-up
* Sign-in
* Habits to be done that day
* Add new habit
* Remove habit that you don't want to do anymore


## Technologies
The following tools and frameworks were used in the construction of the project:

* React App
* React Route
* Styled Components
* Axios

## How to run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies
``` bash
npm i
```
3. Run the front-end with

4. Finally access http://localhost:3000 on your favorite browser
5. The server is already running, so I don't provide a back-end project :)
